#   This project is _not_ indended ever to be made into a distribution
#   package, so we do not have a `[project]` or `[build-system]` section
#   here.
#
#   If you did want (for some unknown reason) to make a distribution
#   package from this, all of the files under src/ need to be moved
#   so that they're not loaded as top-level Python modules. The easiest
#   way to go about this would be to rename the src/ directory to the
#   name of the top-level module you want to use, and do whatever else
#   you need to switch to a flat layout[1] project.

#   binarytree emits a DeprecationWarning at â€¦/binarytree/__init__.py:30
#   saying,
#       pkg_resources is deprecated as an API.
#       See https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html
#   This is due to the line:
#       from pkg_resources import get_distribution
#   This will presumably be fixed in a future version, but for now we
#   ignore just this specific warning when generated at that line.
